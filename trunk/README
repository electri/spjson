			 spjson README

1.Introduction

spjson is a simple json parser written in C++. spjson supports pull-model
and DOM-model json parsing.

The spjson code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested under
Solaris.

You can get the code from the spjson home page:

	http://code.google.com/p/spjson/

2.Building

To build libspjson.so, type

$ make

This will build all the targets include examples. You can run the
example programs:

$ cd spjson
$ testpull ../testcase/gdata.txt
$ testdom  ../testcase/gdata.txt


Any and all comments are appreciated.

Enjoy!
